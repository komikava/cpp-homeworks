# Matrix Row Product Sum

**Task:**  
Write a program that:
1. Takes the number of rows and columns of a matrix as input.
2. Accepts the elements of the matrix from the user.
3. Calculates the sum of the products of the elements of each row.

**Input:**  
- Number of rows `n`  
- Number of columns `m`  
- Matrix elements

**Output:**  
- Sum of the products of the elements of each row.
