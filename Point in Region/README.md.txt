# 📍 Point in Region

**Task:**  
Check whether a point `(x, y)` belongs to a specific region defined by the following inequalities:

y ≤ -0.5 * x + 1
y ≥ 0.5 * x - 1
0 ≤ x ≤ 2

**Input:**  
- Coordinate `x`  
- Coordinate `y`

**Output:**  
- `"The point belongs to the region."` if it lies within the area  
- `"The point does not belong to the region."` otherwise
