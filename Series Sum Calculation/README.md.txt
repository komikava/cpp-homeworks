# ðŸ”¢ Series Sum Calculation

**Task:**  
For the series whose terms are given by the formula:

term(n) = (-1)^n / ((n + 1) * (n + 2) * (n + 3))


1. Calculate the sum of the series with precision `0.000001`.
2. Calculate the sum of the first 10 terms of the series.

**Output:**  
- Sum of the series with a precision of `0.000001`  
- Sum of the first 10 terms of the series
