# ðŸ”¢ Product of Row Sums in Matrix

**Task:**  
1. Enter the number of rows `k` and columns `l` for a matrix.
2. Input the elements of the matrix.
3. Calculate the sum of the elements for each row.
4. Calculate the product of all row sums.
5. Output the final product of row sums.

**Mathematical Formula:**  
- Sum of elements in each row:  
  \[
  S_i = \sum_{j=1}^{l} A_{ij}
  \]
  where \( A_{ij} \) is the element of the matrix at position \(i, j\).
  
- Product of row sums:  
  \[
  P = \prod_{i=1}^{k} S_i
  \]
  where \( S_i \) is the sum of the elements in the i-th row.

**Input:**  
- Number of rows `k`  
- Number of columns `l`  
- Matrix elements

**Output:**  
- Product of row sums.
