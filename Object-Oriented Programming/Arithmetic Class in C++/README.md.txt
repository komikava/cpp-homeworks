# Arithmetic Class in C++

## Description:
This program demonstrates Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++ using a class `Arithmetic`.
The class provides methods to perform basic arithmetic operations on:
two integers, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, and more.

## Features:
- **Addition**: Adds the two integers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second integer from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies the two integers.
- **Division**: Divides the first integer by the second (with zero check).
- **Modulo**: Finds the remainder of division.
- **Power**: Raises the first integer to the power of the second.
- **Average**: Calculates the average of the two integers.
- **Minimum**: Finds the smaller of the two integers.
- **Greater Check**: Compares the two integers to see if the first is greater than the second.
